## Elastic Collision
* View Project [here](https://github.com/jyotirmoy-paul/visual-workspace/tree/master/ElasticCollision)
* Visualization of elastic collisions between two blocks, with one's mass power of 100 times the other one's mass, traces the 
digits of PI
* Motivated by this brilliant youtube video by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs). I wanted to see it for myself.
* Build with [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* Sample Visualization for mass ratio :: 1:100,000,000, tracing 5 digits of PI upto 31415 <br>

## Black Rain
* View Project [here](https://github.com/jyotirmoy-paul/visual-workspace/tree/master/black_rain)
* Formation of rain, using a little physics. I've no idea why I made this.
* This is what it looks like <br>
